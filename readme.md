- **12/5/2021** Only one code sample, how to create a localDb in code. 
- **12/14/2021** Added code in LocalDbLibraryConsoleApp to create a LocalDb version of NorthWind database
  - Drop database code
  - Create database code
  - Populate tables

| Project  | Description
| :--- | :--- |
| LocalDbLibrary | Code to create a localDb in code |
| LocalDbLibraryConsoleApp | Test project for LocalDbLibrary |

# Special note

Creating the database in the console app then attempting to in the windows form app or reverse will cause a runtime exception as the database can not be duplicated. So after running one of the projects and want to run the other detach/delete the first database which is easy in SSMS.

# Requires

- SQL Server Express [LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver15) installed
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher
- In some cases proper permissions to SQL-Server
 
# Recommendations

Have [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (SQL-Server Management Studio) installed

SqlLocalDB.exe is a simple tool that enables the user to easily manage LocalDB instances from the command line. It is implemented as a simple wrapper around the LocalDB instance API. As in many similar SQL Server tools (for example, SQLCMD), parameters are passed to SqlLocalDB as command-line arguments and output is sent to the console.
